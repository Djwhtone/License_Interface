# License_Interface - Personal Project
Create agency invoice based on number of licenses. The intent is to allow users to review and audit a number of license and who has them in the agency. 
Inspired by a current software lacking the feature to manage license in a more analytical way. The intention is to allow users to manage their license allocation and generate an invoice based on the number of active license. User's will be able to pinpoint the agency, users, and number of licenses.
